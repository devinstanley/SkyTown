# SkyTown
A side-project in video game development using .NET with MonoGame. A 2-D topdown work in progress. 

# Current State
Implements a game engine for collision handling, inventory management, entity interactions, resource gathering, NPCs with dialogue and gifting, music, sound effects, and a custom content pipeline to read game-objects.

# Future
Things I would like to add in the future:
- Multiple maps with passages to each
- NPC schedules
- Hand-drawn sprites (most sprites have been taken from the internet)
- Combat
